									<p>Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. collaborated with Statsspeak Group Limited, to
										enhance their data management capabilities. Statsspeak spearheaded several initiatives
										which included creation of a data centralization and integration strategy.
										<br /> 
										They also
										constructed an on-premises data warehouse utilizing an open-source DBMS and
										developed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to gather data from six systems such
										as DHIS2, eLMIS, and LIMs. Additionally, we designed a standardized Exploratory Data
										Analysis (EDA) template for semi-automated cross-country program analyses and
										constructed machine learning algorithms, notably a forecasting and recommendation
										engine for Vaccines eLMIS. All the mentioned efforts resulted in enhanced data-driven
										insights and decision-making capabilities for Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc

									<a href="https://www.health.go.ke/exploring-innovative-tool-monitor-progress-primary-care-networks" class="image fit"><img src="images/Amref-pic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Statsspeak partnered with Amref Health Africa, Kenya, to develop a cutting-edge
										dashboard for monitoring Primary Care Networks (PCNs) in alignment with Kenya's
										universal health coverage agenda and digital healthcare initiatives.
										<br /> 
										This dashboard
										enables real-time tracking of critical healthcare elements like the referral system,
										maternal and child health outcomes and disease trends. By harnessing data from the
										dashboard, policymakers and healthcare providers gain valuable insights to make
										informed decisions and allocate resources strategically. The collaborative effort involved
										key stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health, county governments, and development
										partners, marking a significant milestone in advancing data-driven healthcare excellence
										and universal health coverage across Kenya.

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/statsspeak/Credit_Scoring" class="image fit"><img src="images/creditscoring.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Awash Bank, a leading financial institution in Ethiopia, aimed to modernize its services by introducing a mobile loan service.
										 To ensure responsible lending, they needed a robust credit scoring system. They partnered with Statsspeak Kenya Limited to develop a hybrid system,
										  combining traditional rule-based algorithms and advanced machine learning models.
										   This approach allowed them to accurately assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. 
										   Through iterative testing and refinement, the system was optimized for accuracy. Moving forward, Statsspeak will continue to work with 
										   Awash Bank to adapt the system to changing customer behaviors and market conditions.
