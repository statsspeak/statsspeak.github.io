									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/CHAI.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. collaborated with Statsspeak Group Limited, to
										enhance their data management capabilities. Statsspeak spearheaded several initiatives
										which included creation of a data centralization and integration strategy. They also
										constructed an on-premises data warehouse utilizing an open-source DBMS and
										developed an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline to gather data from six systems such
										as DHIS2, eLMIS, and LIMs. Additionally, we designed a standardized Exploratory Data
										Analysis (EDA) template for semi-automated cross-country program analyses and
										constructed machine learning algorithms, notably a forecasting and recommendation
										engine for Vaccines eLMIS. All the mentioned efforts resulted in enhanced data-driven
										insights and decision-making capabilities for Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc.</p>
